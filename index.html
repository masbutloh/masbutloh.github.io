                As a football fan, I could do nothing but marvel at Real Madrid’s incredible achievement, despite not being the supporter of this great club. There were so many talks throughout the season regarding their constant dips in form, which basically started circulating ever since they had comprehensively dispatched FC Barcelona in the Spanish Super Cup over two legs.

                After Real finished second in the group and were drawn against Paris Saint-Germain in the last-16, with the French club being in impressive form at the time, Madrid were not seen as clear favourites to progress. However, they seem to know how to really play and, most importantly, win in the UCL.

                Then, there was Juventus against which Real got somewhat lucky at the end of the second match, but it could also be said that the foul in the box was worthy of a penalty. It was the heat of the moment that sparked so much controversy.

                In the semifinal, Bayern Munich did not score the moments they would surely need to convert to eliminate Real. But again, the Spanish club was not at fault for the missed opportunities on the part of Germans. ‘Real’ winners tend to have some luck involved here and there in whatever it is they do and succeed in. And it is the result that matters at the end of the day.

                On that note, Liverpool were real contenders to stop Madrid’s hegemony in the UCL and they were playing decent football in the first half. Loris Karius grabbed the headlines for the mistakes he committed and, of course, Ramos’ foul on Salah, which I think did not carry any deliberate intent in it. Karius would probably never make such horrible mistakes in succession ever in his career going forward. But, Real still legitimately outplayed Liverpool in key moments.

                So, from a personal perspective, I view this Madrid’s record-breaking streak of the UCL victories through the prism of pure class and talent of the squad, mental strength to get the job done and also Zidane’s enormous positive impact on the team and club in general, as he has been so well-respected and carried himself professionally at all times throughout his great tenure at the club.
